Build and integrate apps with Cerner.

Terra is Cerner's open-source platform for creating web applications integrating into the Cerner application ecosystem. Built on a foundation of [React](https://reactjs.org/), Terra provides the building blocks to construct accessible single-page applications. More than just a component library, Terra offers solutions to common application problems such as internationalization, modal presentation, unsaved changes, loading overlays, and themes. Terra also offers a reuseable set of configurable react components to help build out applications. Similar to Apple's [appkit](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit), these [React components](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/components) are designed to be building blocks that are composed into higher-order workflows and components to represent your concepts.

Not content to stop at application construct, Terra also offers a development and testing enviroment with [terra-dev-site](https://github.com/cerner/terra-dev-site) and [terra-toolkit](https://github.com/cerner/terra-toolkit). This toolkit helps you wepback your application as well as run unit and functional testing, including accessiblity.

Check out the [Getting Started Guide](https://engineering.cerner.com/terra-ui/getting-started/terra-ui/installing-components) to install your first Terra component and begin building an application.
