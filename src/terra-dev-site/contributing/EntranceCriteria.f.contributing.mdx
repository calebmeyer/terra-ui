# Entrance Criteria

## UX Approval

Any component that gets added in Terra, requires the approval of Cerner's UX design team. This team ensures general UX consistency of the Terra component library.

## Proprietary Concerns

Terra is open source. Thus, components should not leak or depend on internal Cerner intellectual property.

## Reusability

As Terra is a multi-concept UX library, all the components that are contained therein must be broadly reusable. Thus, Terra excludes the inclusion of niche components with a small amount of consumers.

## Meets Existing Standards

Terra has a set of standards that *must* be followed by all components.  This includes:

* Accessibility
* Browser Support
* Theme Support
* i18n Support
* RTL Support
* Jest/WDIO Test Coverage
