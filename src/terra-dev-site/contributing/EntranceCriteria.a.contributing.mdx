# Entrance Criteria

## UX Approval

Terra requires the approval of Cerner's UX design team for both component enhancements and new components added to our library. This team ensures general UX consistency of the Terra component library. To start the contribution process, be sure to log an issue for the UX team to review.

## Proprietary Concerns

Terra is open source. Thus, components should not leak or depend on internal Cerner intellectual property.

## Reusability

As Terra is a multi-concept UX library, all the components that are contained therein must be broadly reusable. Thus, Terra excludes the inclusion of niche components with a small amount of consumers.

## Meets Existing Standards

Terra has a set of standards that *must* be followed by all components.  This includes:

* Accessibility
* Browser Support
* Theme Support
* Internationalization Support
* RTL Support
* Jest and WDIO Test Coverage

For more specifics see the [component standards page](/contributing/terra-ui/component-standards)
