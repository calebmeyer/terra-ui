# Contribution Guidelines

These guidelines are geared more towards medium and large component contributions.

## Contribution Kickoff

A contribution kickoff involving UX, Terra, and the contributing team needs to happen up front. The goals of this meeting are:

* Determine scope of the contribution
* Allocate UX personnel
* Allocate Terra engineering personnel
* Establish general timelines for all parties

## Allocated UX Support and Design

UX needs to be involved from the beginning of the contribution. It is expected that UX will provide guidance on:

* All themes
* Accessibility
* Design standards

## Allocated Terra Engineering Support

A certain percentage of a Terra engineer's time will need to be allocated from the Terra team's availability. This percentage will be based on the size and complexity of the contribution.

## Contributor Expectations

To ensure there are no surprises on PRs and the resulting component, contributors are expected to have regular syncs with the allocated UX and Terra Engineers. This can include periodic meetings and/or attending scrum.

## Long Term Maintenance

After the component is merged into master, Terra will take on ownership of the component.  This ownership will include:

* Support
* Releases
* Enhancements
